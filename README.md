# LS3-TFR-theme01
First attempt to develop theme for Limesurvey 3

April 2018: we now think that LimeSurvey 3.x.x is getting more and more stable.

We started to experiment with the much wanted feature of extending the Vanilla template. Of course we hoped that the twig files that riside in the vanilla template are so "dry" and well formed, that we only have to adapt the CSS, but we are not that far yet.

We developed this using version Version 3.6.2+180406. We have not tried to use this template in other versions.

Please help us wit the following: 
* use this template
* observe what you see: are things going wrong?
* do things look ugly?
* are you missing specific features?

We do not guaranty anything, but we will sincerely look at issue tickets.

Feel free to adapt to your needs, just tell us what you improved.

# Next steps
* discuss improvements on vanilla theme
* make workarounds for peculiarities in vanilla theme
* extend the theme further with helper classes that enhance questions when you add the class to the question
